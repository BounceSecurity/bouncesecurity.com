At Bounce Security, we care about doing security the right way.   
For us, that means focusing on protecting what *really* matters. Instead of wasting your limited resources on generic, so-called "best practices", draining your developers' cycles or squandering budget on expensive and ineffective consultants.  

That is why we've developed our "**Value Driven Security**" approach, to save you time and money, and to enable a more efficient security process.   
"Value-Driven Security" is a much better fit than common purist approaches, for modern development teams looking to design and implement security features in their software, without disrupting their natural flow.   
Having strong technical background and an intelligent risk analysis framework in place not only helps discover security risks, but also allows us to make pragmatic decisions and recommend *against* spending on risks that do not affect your bottom line.

Security Roadmapping:
We offer our Security Roadmapping service as a way to help you understand where you’re going, how long it will take, how much fuel (budget) you can expect to use, and what risks face us along the way.
Focusing on high-level business context and constraints, the Security Roadmap takes a  value-driven  approach  to  optimizeinvestment  in  security  efforts.  This  will  detail which  security  activities  should  be  prioritized  in  your  organization,  and  why. These will enable you to reduce overall risk with cost-efficient tasks aligned with overall business priorities and based on your teams’ deep understanding of their product environment and architecture. 
The  purpose  of  the  Roadmap  is  to  plan  work  more  efficiently, ensure  security investment  is  aligned  with  what  your  company  actually  needs  (instead  of  generic “Best Practices”), and provide a set of long-term security targets. 

Threat Modeling Workshop:
Threat modeling, a structured methodology for security-based analysis of a complex system, can help you identify and prioritize potential threats and attack vectors, and understand the appropriate mitigations. A good threat model is essential for a robust, secure design and architecture, and can support mitigation of all relevant threats. This can also build customer confidence.  
Our primary objective is to help you get to your end goal as quickly and effectively as possible. Your architects and development teams should be responsible for the security of their products, and consider this aspect as a normal part of building the features. As an outcome of this workshop, they will have the skillset, knowledge, and experience to be able to build basic threat models themselves, and recognize when they need to consult with experts for more advanced analysis. 

Software Security Consulting:
Perhaps you are not yet ready for a full-fledged security program, for any of a number of valid reasons. Or maybe your security program is already mature, but you still need advice on a specific issue from an expert in security architecture.
For smaller projects, we can provide Standalone Consulting as needed. This would include meetings, staff interviews, and group discussions on-site as needed, as well as any additional information gathering, in-depth research, and hands-on proof of concepts we may need.
